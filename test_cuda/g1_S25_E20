Graph generation:
	graph type = GENERATING SIMPLE RANDOM
	vertices   = 33554432
	edges      = 671088640
	Mirroring edges -> Graph will be undirected, nedges = 1342177259
	Removing self loop and multi edges
N egdes 1342177259



	Edges after removing = 1342176346
The number of edges in the undirected graph is 1342177259
